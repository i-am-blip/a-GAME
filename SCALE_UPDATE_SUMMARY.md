# 🎮 Visual Balance Update: 2x Scale

## ✨ Adjustments Made

### 1. **2x Global Scaling**
- 🔍 **Zoom Level**: Reduced from 3x to **2x**.
- 📏 **Player Size**: Now takes up **~4.4%** of screen height (approx 48px on 1080p).
- 👁️ **View Distance**: Significantly increased horizontal visibility.
  - *Previous (3x)*: ~30 tiles visible.
  - *New (2x)*: ~50 tiles visible on desktop (allows for much better jump planning).

### 2. **UI Refinement**
- **Balanced Overlay**: HUD and Game Over screens scaled to 1.5x original size (down from 2.5x).
- **Readability**: Text is clear and legible without dominating the gameplay area.
- **Padding**: Reduced to comfortably fit the new view without crowding.

### 3. **Gameplay Impact**
- **Reaction Time**: Player can see obstacles much further ahead.
- **Verticality**: More vertical space visible, making high jumps and deep falls less disorienting.
- **Experience**: Feels less "claustrophobic" than the previous retro-zoom mode, while still maintaining the pixel art aesthetic.

This update hits the "sweet spot" between modern playability and retro aesthetics.
