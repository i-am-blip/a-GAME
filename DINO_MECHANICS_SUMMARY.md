# 🦖 Mechanics Update: Dino Style Runner

## ⚙️ Core Gameplay Changes

### 1. **Fixed Position / Auto-Run**
- **Player Movement**: Horizontal control has been completely **removed**. The player character stays fixed on the left side of the screen.
- **Auto-Scroll**: The world moves automatically towards the left. The player's only interaction is **JUMPING** to avoid obstacles and gaps.

### 2. **One-Hit Death System** 💀
- **Lives Removed**: The 3-heart system is gone.
- **Fail States**:
  - Falling into a pit/water.
  - Hitting a wall/platform side.
  - Touching an enemy.
  - Hitting a crate.
- **Result**: Instant **Game Over**.

### 3. **Distance Scoring** 📏
- **Primary Score**: Increases automatically based on distance traveled (+1 per ~10 pixels).
- **Secondary Score**: Coins now provide a +50 point bonus but are optional risks.

## 🎨 Visuals (Maintained)
- **Rich World**: The game still features the "Rich World" aesthetic with deep terrain chunks, water, decorations, and parallax backgrounds from the previous update.
- **Best of Both Worlds**: The simple, addictive mechanics of the Chrome Dinosaur game combined with a vibrant, detailed pixel art world.
