# 🚀 Deployment Guide

Since `node`, `npm`, and `git` are not detected in your terminal, the easiest way to deploy your game is using **Drag & Drop** services.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Recommended)
1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Locate your project folder:
   `d:\My Work\AI Exploration\a GAME`
3. Drag the entire **"a GAME"** folder onto the Netlify drop zone.
4. Netlify will deploy it instantly and give you a public URL (e.g., `fluffy-unicorn-123456.netlify.app`).

## Option 2: Surge.sh (Requires Node/NPM)
If you install Node.js later:
1. Open terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npx surge`.
3. Follow the prompts to create an account and pick a domain.

## Files to Deploy
Ensure these files are in the folder you upload:
- `index.html` (The entry point)
- `style.css`
- `game.js`
- `kenney_pixel-platformer/` (Assets folder)
